# HR Analytics – Predict Employee Attrition

## 📄 Introduction
This project aims to analyze HR employee data and predict attrition (whether an employee is likely to leave the company) using Python.

## 📁 Files Included
- `WA_Fn-UseC_-HR-Employee-Attrition.csv` — Dataset
- `hr_attrition_analysis.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook (Phase 1)
- `hr_attrition_summary.pdf` — Summary Report

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

## 🔍 What’s Done So Far
- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the dataset.
- Plotted important graphs and summarized key insights.
- Exported the analysis as a PDF.

## ✅ Upcoming
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing (Phase 2)
- Model Building
- Dashboard in Power BI

## 🚀 Phase 2: Predictive Modeling

### 🔸 Objective:
Build a classification model to predict employee attrition using logistic regression.

### 🔸 Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Google Colab

### 🔸 Key Steps:
- Data cleaning and encoding
- Feature selection
- Logistic regression model training
- Evaluation using confusion matrix and accuracy score

### 🔸 Outcome:
Model built with accuracy score and insights that can help HR teams reduce attrition.

## 📊 Phase 3 – Dashboard Design (Power BI)

In this phase, I used Power BI to create an interactive dashboard to visualize important insights from the HR dataset. The goal was to identify patterns and trends related to employee attrition.

### 🔧 Tools Used:
- Power BI

### 📈 Charts Created:
1. **Count of Attrition by Age** – Displays how age affects attrition.
2. **Count of Attrition by Department** – Shows attrition trends across departments.
3. **Attrition by Business Travel** – Visualizes how frequent travel correlates with attrition.
4. **Attrition by Job Role** – Analyzes which roles have higher attrition.
5. **Attrition by Gender** – Shows if gender has an impact on leaving rate.
6. **Attrition by Marital Status** – Correlates attrition with personal life factors.

### 📌 Output:
- Power BI `.pbix` file uploaded in the repository under Phase 3.
